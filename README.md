Business Data Management Capstone Project | IIT Madras

Student: Ayan Hussain

Roll Number: 23f1000932

Institute: IIT Madras (BS Degree Program)

📖 Project Overview

Good Luck Furniture is a small-scale, family-owned business in Prayagraj, UP, specializing in handcrafted wooden furniture. Despite a reputation for quality, the business faced operational bottlenecks including severe seasonal stockouts, capital tied up in unsold inventory, and unpredictable production delays.

This project utilizes 2 years of primary sales and supplier data (2023-2025) to diagnose these issues and provide a data-driven roadmap for sustainable growth.

⚠️ The Problem Statement

Through initial interviews and observation, three core challenges were identified:

Seasonal Stock Shortages: Significant loss of revenue during festive seasons (Diwali/Wedding season) due to lack of inventory planning.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Unpredictable delays in raw materials leading to late customer deliveries.

Underperforming Portfolio: "Dead stock" occupying valuable showroom space while high-demand items were unavailable.

🛣️ My Approach & Methodology

To solve these problems, I followed a structured data analytics lifecycle:

Data Collection: * Digitized manual record books into Google Sheets.

Collected 80 verified sales transactions and 22 supplier orders.

Data points included: Order Date, Cost Price, Selling Price, Supplier Name, Promised vs Actual Delivery Date.

Data Cleaning:

Standardized date formats and currency.

Calculated new metrics: Profit Margin, Delivery Delay (Days), and Year-over-Year Growth.

Analytical Techniques:

Time-Series Analysis: To visualize the "Boom & Bust" seasonal cycles.

Pareto Analysis: To identify which product categories drive the majority of profits.

Correlation Analysis: To test if pricing strategies were affecting sales volume.

Supplier Performance Benchmarking: To identify specific bottlenecks in the supply chain.

💡 Key Data Insights

The analysis revealed critical insights that were previously unknown to the business owner:

Extreme Seasonality: Profits in November (Peak) are 10x higher than in September (Monsoon low). The business was not stocking up in anticipation of this.

Profit Concentration: Just two categories—'Bed' (33%) and 'Custom' (30.8%)—generate nearly 64% of total profit.

The Bottleneck: While most suppliers had a delay of <1 day, one specific supplier, "Sheesham Crafts Inc.", had an average delay of 5.5 days, causing the majority of production issues.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the data, I proposed three specific solutions:

Seasonal Inventory Plan: * Action: Procure raw materials for top 10 "Star Products" 30% in advance of September.

Goal: Capture the forecasted ₹1.67 Lakh profit for the 2025 peak season.

"Bundle & Clear" Strategy:

Action: Bundle underperforming items (e.g., Rocking Chairs) with high-demand beds at a discount.

Goal: Liquidate dead stock to free up capital for high-margin 'Custom' orders.

Supplier Diversification:

Action: Shift 50% of orders from "Sheesham Crafts Inc." to alternative local suppliers (e.g., Rajesh Timber Store).

Goal: Reduce average production delays from 5 days to 2 days.
